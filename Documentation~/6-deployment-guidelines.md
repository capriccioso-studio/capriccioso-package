# Game Development Environments and Release Plan

## Environments

In the game development phase, three distinct environments are typically used, each serving a unique purpose:

### Development Environment

**Purpose:** This is where initial development occurs. Developers write and test new code, features, and fixes.

**Characteristics:**

- **Dynamic:** Characterized by frequent code changes and updates.
- **Isolated:** Separate from user-facing environments to prevent unfinished features or bugs from impacting users.
- **Tools:** May include advanced debugging tools and detailed logging.

**Use:** Used by developers for developing new features, bug fixes, and experimenting with new ideas.

### Staging Environment

**Purpose:** Acts as a pre-production environment, closely mimicking the production setup. It's primarily used for the Quality Assurance (QA) phase before production.

**Characteristics:**

- **Mirror of Production:** Mimics the production environment, including hardware, software, and database configurations.
- **Testing Ground:** Used for performance testing, load testing, and solving environment-specific bugs.

**Use:** Accessed by testers and developers for QA. Sometimes limited user testing (beta testing) is done here.

### Production Environment

**Purpose:** The live environment where the game is available to the end-users post-development.

**Characteristics:**

- **Stable and Secure:** Optimized for stability and security.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Equipped with tools for monitoring performance, user activity, and error logging.
- **Post-Gold:** Refers to the phase after the game has reached "Gold Status," indicating it is complete and ready for release.

**Use:** Used by end-users. Post-launch updates, patches, and new features are deployed here after thorough testing in the previous environments.

Each environment plays a crucial role in ensuring that the game is thoroughly developed, tested, and ready for public release.

## Release Plan

At the end of each sprint, developers focus on finalizing new features and bug fixes, ensuring code quality through unit testing, and integrating their work into the main codebase. This culminates in a new release, which is then deployed to the QA environment for thorough testing. The key steps involve:

- **Finalizing Development:** Completing coding tasks and wrapping up feature implementation.
- **Unit Testing:** Running tests to verify individual parts of the code work correctly.
- **Code Integration:** Merging code into the main branch, ensuring compatibility and stability.
- **Release Preparation:** Preparing the codebase for deployment, addressing any last-minute adjustments.
- **Deployment to QA:** Releasing the new version to the QA environment for the next phase of testing.

This process ensures a steady and consistent delivery of new, test-ready software at the end of each development sprint.
